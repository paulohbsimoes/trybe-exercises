  <h1>Animal group names</h1>

  <p>For many species of animals, there are names that we use to refer to a group of them - like a flock of birds. Here
    are a few you might not know.</p>

  <h2>A skulk of foxes</h2>

  <p>Also called a "leash."</p>

  This is a webpage about animal group names, with a few headings and images as examples.
  There are already 2 CSS rules to style the <h1>s - one with a pseudo selector, and one without. Add another selector to each of the rules, so that they also style <h2>s. -->
