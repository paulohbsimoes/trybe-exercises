        <p>The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The
            sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen
            cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the
            sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally
            divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as
            the Mediterranean, are known as seas.

            Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided
            between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the
            open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked
            waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are
            sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface
            currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea
            level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and
            submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).

    1 - This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a <div>. In this first step, style the <div> that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.
    2 - Now, make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.
    3 - In this last step, write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text. -->
