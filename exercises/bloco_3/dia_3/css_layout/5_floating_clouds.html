  <h1>What are clouds?</h1>

  <div id="cloud-sidebar">
    <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
    <p>Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow
      color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen
      dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.

  <p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals
    suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as
    aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

  <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of
    two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the
    surface.</p>

  This webpage contains information on clouds plus a photo of clouds. In the first step, float the photo to the left of the text, so that the text wraps around it.
  There's a yellow div of information. Make that div float to the right of the text, so that the photo is on the left side of the text and the yellow div is on the right side of the text.
  Now that we have elements floated next to eachother, we should make sure to separate them with some whitespace. Add appropriate margins to the photo and the sidebar. -->
